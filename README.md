Gemini Expert is a versatile web application that allows users to create specialized mini-apps tailored to specific tasks, enhancing productivity and providing instant insights. The app leverages the powerful capabilities of the Gemini API to perform a variety of functions:

ATS Expert: This mini-app analyzes uploaded resumes, identifying areas that need improvement to increase the chances of passing Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). It provides users with actionable feedback on whatâ€™s missing or needs enhancement in their resumes.

Nutrition Expert: By simply uploading an image of food, users can instantly receive detailed nutritional information, including calorie content, helping them make informed dietary choices. The Gemini API processes the image and retrieves the necessary data with accuracy and speed.

PDF Expert: This Retrieval-Augmented Generative App (RAG) allows users to upload a PDF document and ask any question related to its content. The app uses the Gemini API to efficiently scan, analyze, and generate precise answers, making it easy to extract valuable information without manually searching through the document.

YouTube Transcripter: Simply provide a YouTube video link, and this mini-app will generate a comprehensive transcript and detailed notes, making it easy to summarize and understand the content without watching the entire video.

By integrating the Gemini API, Gemini Expert transforms everyday tasks into seamless, automated processes, saving users time and providing accurate, AI-driven results tailored to their specific needs.
